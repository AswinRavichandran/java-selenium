1) What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.
	Selenium is used to automate web application.
	Selenium is not used for desktop base application automation i.e., games, calculator etc..
Components of Selenium:
Selenium IDE
Selenium RC
 Selenium WebDriver
Selenium Grid
Selenium Webdriver:
              Selenium webdriver is better than IDE and RC.
              Selenium webdriver is more stable than RC.
              It controls the browser by directly communicating with it.
              It also supports multiple programming languages.

2) How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?
	Selenium webdriver is a tool that helps selenium to interact with the various web browsers. 
	Every browser has a separate webdriver to communicate.

3.What are the locators available  to find an element using Selenium?
	 There are about 8 locators available in selenium :
              ID
              Class Name
              TagName
              LinkText
              Class
              Partial LinkText
              Xpath
              CSS selector

4. Why ID is preferable than X-Path?
	ID is considered as unique key so there cannot be more than 1 elements for same ID while Xpath is created using relative path/position of elements, 
so there can be cases when we can get 2 or more elements for same Xpath.

5.How to select value in dropdown?
	* Find the drop down using FindElement
      * Create object for select class passing dropdown element as parameter
      * Select the value from dropdown values
methods in select class:
      *selectByIndex(int index)
      *selectByValue(String value)
      *selectByVisibleText(String Text)
      *getOptions( )
      *getFirstSelectedOption ( )
      *getAllSelectedOptions( )
      *isMultiple( )
      *deSelectByValue (String value)
      *deselectByIndex(int Index)
      *deselectByVisibleText (String text)
      * deselectAll( )

6) What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?
	Absolute xpath: It uses complete path from the root element to a desired element.
        Relative xpath: You can simply start by referencing the element you want and go from there.

7) How to verify if the given check box is checked or not (it is not taught but you can explore) Try here: http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html
		In order to check if a checkbox is checked or unchecked, we can used the isSelected() method over the checkbox element. 
		The isSelected() method returns a boolean value of true if the checkbox is checked false otherwise.

8)Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager
	WebDriverManager automates the browser setup in the Selenium code. By default, 
it downloads the latest version of the browser binary and also the binary for the appropriate platform.
	setProperty method is used to configure the browser driver path.

9) Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths.
following:
           Xpath=//*[@attribute='value']//following:: input
preceeding:
	   Xpath= //*[@attribute='value']//preceding::input

10) How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?
	The getAttribute() method helps to get the value of any attribute of a web element, which is returned as a String.
